=== levels/nand_gate ===

$17420270098223 In this level the challenge is to figure out how the NAND component works. Be [color=#dd6576]sure[/color] to figure it out before you complete this level, or you will get stuck next level!

=== levels/decoder ===

$16133643476631 The circuit you built in the "Registers" level can copy values between registers, while the "Arithmetic Engine" can do different operations on 2 inputs. But you need to be able to do both in the same circuit. To do this, build a "decoder", which will decide which mode our computer is in, based on the 2 bits we haven't used yet.

To distinguish between the [INSTRUCTIONS] of 4 different kinds, the two highest bits will be used to determine which MODE we are in as follows:
[OFF] [OFF] [ANY] [ANY] [ANY] [ANY] [ANY] [ANY] Immediate
[OFF] [ON] [ANY] [ANY] [ANY] [ANY] [ANY] [ANY] Calculate
[ON] [OFF] [ANY] [ANY] [ANY] [ANY] [ANY] [ANY] Copy
[ON] [ON] [ANY] [ANY] [ANY] [ANY] [ANY] [ANY] Condition

Here [ANY] means any value.

Determine the MODE we are in from the input, then send [ON] to the correct output.

=== levels/RAM ===

$17967666262990 In this test, first copy from input 32 times and store these values. After you have loaded the 32 values, output them in the same order as you got them. Outputting before you have read all the inputs will fail the level.
$13520918982355 Add a ram block, so the computer can address 256 additional bytes of memory. You need a way to decide which of the 256 bytes inside the ram we are addressing. Select a register and wire it up, so its value always selects the RAM address. When you later want to load or save to the RAM, you will have to first copy the RAM address to this register.

If you choose to go on to the rest of the levels I will teach you about ram, the stack and function calls and you will get to solve more interesting challenges like this one.
		
But first you would have to build a better computer. [color=#e49f44]OVERTURE[/color] was good as a first machine, but it is clumsy and programs get very messy. To solve the challenges I have for you without pulling all your hair out, you will need something more expressive, the [color=#e49f44]LEG[/color] architecture.

[tip]Remember you can't use immedate values larger than 63, a common mistake is to try to jump to a label further down than the 63rd byte.[/tip]


=== levels/negative_numbers ===

$12574817679356
We need a way to have negative values in bytes. The scheme we have been using so far can represent all numbers from 0 to 255 using a byte. This scheme is called "unsigned", since it only deals with positive numbers.

We need a scheme that allows negative numbers, normally referred to as a "signed" representation. 

Additionally, it would greatly simplify future circuits if the representation works with the adder you already made. 
$17231048881956 To know the difference between things, you need subtraction. To get subtraction, first you need negative numbers.
$19118970740682
[color=#dd6576]Edit the numbers[/color] for each bit so that the following is true:

[color=#e49f44]1[/color]: All numbers from -127 to 127 should also be representable
[color=#e49f44]2[/color]: Bytes representing anything from 0 to 127 should be the same as unsigned
[color=#e49f44]3[/color]: The new number system should work with the adder (for results between -127 and 127).


=== levels/robot_race ===

$12641789008694 Create a circuit that always outputs the number 164.


=== levels/any_doubles ===

$16587030847545 Because we are so technologically advanced we have machines fold our socks. Unfortunately the circuit that detects sock pairs broke on the machine.
$14373083988184
This level has 4 inputs. 
Output [ON] when 2 or more of them are [ON].

[tip]Don't overthink this level.[/tip]


=== levels/call_ret ===

$15840165316981
In this level you are tasked with implementing function calls and returns with the [color=#e49f44]call[/color] and [color=#e49f44]ret[/color] instructions.

Note that when returning from a function, you should jump to the address that came AFTER the [color=#e49f44]call[/color] instruction, otherwise you will end with an infinite loop.
The [color=#e49f44]call[/color] instruction has to do the following:
 [i]- Add the instruction width to the counter value and [color=#e49f44]push[/color] it on the stack[/i]
 [i]- Jump to the function address[/i]

The [color=#e49f44]ret[/color] instruction has to do the following:
 [i]- [color=#e49f44]Pop[/color] return address from the stack and jump to it[/i]

You can pass information to and from a function by saving the data to registers as normal. Also be aware of which registers a function will overwrite before calling it.

$19416009887091
Sometimes it is useful to reuse a section of code. We call these sections "functions". To implement this reuse, one can [color=#e63e5b][url=termonology]jump[/url][/color] to the beginning of the function and jump back again at the end of the function. We call jumping to the function "calling" the function, and jumping back from the function "returning" from the function. 
	
But for this section of code to actually be reusable, the return jump will have to be able to return to different locations, depending on where we called the function from.

We could save the counter value to a register before jumping to the function and use this value when returning. However, if done this way, a function would not be able to call another function, since this would overwrite the original return address.

Say function A calls function B, who calls function C. When we want to return from C, we only need the return address for B and in B we only need the address for A. In general, regardless of which function we look at and how they are nested, the last return address we added is always the first one we will need again. This is exactly the behavior of the stack.
$19369640789869 Budget cuts have led to cutting salaries, but now the lab assistants are on strike. You will have to self-assess in this test. This will tell us something about your honesty and maturity.

=== levels/double_buffer ===

$17366913897135 Construct a circuit that outputs the same as the input, just delayed by 2 ticks.
$17497477227061
In the last level you unlocked the Delay Line. It outputs its own input, just 1 tick late.

[img]dialogue/delay_buffer.png[/img]


=== levels/push_pop2 ===

$10062117579269 Add the stack to your computer
$14685569269160
In this level you are supposed to add the stack to your computer and write the program that solves the level.
When the input is 0, you should [color=#e49f44]pop[/color] a value off the stack and output it. When the input is not 0, you should [color=#e49f44]push[/color] it on the stack.


=== levels/odd_ticks ===

$18510295620397 Output [OFF] on the even ticks and [ON] on the odd ticks.
$16987046679863 In a previous level you learned how we don't allow circular dependencies. Now you must learn the one exception.
$16037516781370
Square pins in the game never affect the output in the same tick. They therefore never cause circular dependencies.
	
	[img]dialogue/delay_buffer.png[/img]
$17588119878416
The delay line is allowed to depend on its own input. This is because its input does not influence the rest of the circuit until next tick.
	
[img]dialogue/delay_buffer.png[/img]


=== levels/byte_adder ===

$16888130664370
If the result does not fit in 8 bits, turn the output carry [ON] (you can think of it as the 9th bit)
	
Finally, there is an input carry as well. This is useful for chaining together byte adders to add larger numbers. You can think of this carry as adding either 0 [OFF] or 1 [ON].

Use [color=#e63e5b][url=byte_adder]this hint[/url][/color] if you get stuck.
$18732877690173 Add the two input bytes. Each output bit in the output should be a result of the addition of the corresponding bits from the inputs, and potentially a carry.


=== levels/tick_tock ===

$17940006660359 Count
$17263901743088
Build a counter that will increase by 1 each tick.

Additionally, there should be an option for overwriting the counter with a given value.

You are given 2 inputs, a bit and a byte.

The bit input should toggle between counting and overwriting with the value of the byte.

$13740696609075
In this level you have 2 inputs.

The second input is the value to be [color=#e49f44]saved[/color].

Always output what is currently [color=#e49f44]saved[/color].


=== levels/turing_complete ===

$16583885726240 Yes you did it! I thought you were just this odd looking hairless ape creature, but you actually built a real computer! Amazing.
$10510746154639 At tick 1 the program should load address 1.
$10317244906317 No program found
$14587485007736 Until this point all possible programs have been confined to running in order byte by byte.
$19649119273248
The final thing we need to add is a mechanism for changing the program counter through [INSTRUCTIONS] when certain conditions are met.

When the two largest bits are [ON][ON], we are in condition mode. In condition mode, the value in REG 3 is compared against the conditions defined by the lowest 3 bits in the instruction. If the condition is true, we overwrite the counter to the value in REG 0.
Conditionally changing the counter means we can skip [INSTRUCTIONS] based on conditions or have [INSTRUCTIONS] run in a loop.

Conditions:
[OFF] [OFF] [OFF] Never
[OFF] [OFF] [ON] If [color=#e49f44]REG 3[/color] = 0
[OFF] [ON] [OFF] If [color=#e49f44]REG 3[/color] < 0
[OFF] [ON] [ON] If [color=#e49f44]REG 3[/color] ≤ 0 
[ON] [OFF] [OFF] Always
[ON] [OFF] [ON] If [color=#e49f44]REG 3[/color] ≠ 0 
[ON] [ON] [OFF] If [color=#e49f44]REG 3[/color] ≥ 0
[ON] [ON] [ON] If [color=#e49f44]REG 3[/color] > 0

These conditions correspond to the condition component that was saved in the component factory.


=== levels/leg_4 ===

$10794262854382
Add if statements to your circuit. For the if statements, the 2 arguments are compared and if the condition is true, the counter is set to a jump address.
	
The previous instructions had the 4 bytes represent:
[code][color=#87a8c8]OPCODE, ARGUMENT_1, ARGUMENT_2, RESULT[/color][/code]

For if statements the bytes represent:
[code][color=#87a8c8]OPCODE, ARGUMENT_1, ARGUMENT_2, JUMP_ADDRESS[/color][/code]

In addition to the previous opcodes, add:
[code][color=#87a8c8]32 IF_EQUAL
33 IF_NOT_EQUAL
34 IF_LESS
35 IF_LESS_OR_EQUAL
36 IF_GREATER
37 IF_GREATER_OR_EQUAL[/color][/code]

Use unsigned less / greater for the comparisons.

Each opcode does what their name implies. For example the following jumps to byte 16 if REG0 is less than REG1: 
[code][color=#87a8c8]IF_LESS REG0 REG1 16[/color][/code]

=== levels/leg_1 ===

$17106892574116 Add a counter to the circuit
$15754373587500 Set the counter increment to 4
$19099471819164
The following are the set up steps that needs to be done in order to complete this level:
		
[b]1.[/b] Click the schematic icon ([b][i][/i][/b]) and create a new empty architecture.
[b]2.[/b] Place a program block with 4 outputs.
[b]3.[/b] Place a counter, set its increment to 4 and connect it to the program block.
[b]4.[/b] Add 6 registers (or custom components with registers)
[b]5.[/b] Click "Edit watched state" on the program component and connect registers to 0 to 5. Connect the counter to 6 and the output to 7.

$18860645759682
The [color=#e49f44]LEG[/color] architecture is a computer that takes 4 bytes per tick from the program. 

The first byte describes the operation (called the [color=#e49f44]OPCODE[/color]).

Since many operations take 2 arguments (like ADD, OR etc), the second and third byte are for arguments.

And since most operations return 1 result, the fourth byte is for the result.
	
	[img]dialogue/leg_diagram_1.png[/img]
$11377431500625 Add 6 registers to the map
$14051336765362 Finally it is time for you to start building the [color=#e49f44]LEG[/color] architecture!

$19066122929275 [center]Set up registers and implement the ADD opcode[/center]
$10912834168905
Finally, in this level the [color=#e49f44]OPCODE[/color] is always 0. This means we ADD argument 1 and argument 2 and save the result to the destination.

The value of an argument or destination refers to one of these places:
[code]
[color=#e49f44]0[/color]: Register 0
[color=#e49f44]1[/color]: Register 1
[color=#e49f44]2[/color]: Register 2
[color=#e49f44]3[/color]: Register 3
[color=#e49f44]4[/color]: Register 4
[color=#e49f44]5[/color]: Register 5
[color=#e49f44]6[/color]: Counter
[color=#e49f44]7[/color]: Input/Output
[/code]

In the next level you will implement more [color=#e49f44]OPCODES[/color], which will require a different ALU than that of [color=#e49f44]OVERTURE[/color].

$13880985462901 Make a circuit where the input of a component depends on its own output
$18010308863615
Create a "circular dependency". This is a circuit where the input of a component relies on its own output. In a circular dependency situation, it is not possible to determine the output of a component, because you would first need to determine the input, which relies on the output and so on (hence the "circular").

This state is normally not allowed in other levels, but in this level the goal is to create it, so you understand what it is before going forward.

Integer divide two numbers to find the quotient and the remainder. Consider the fraction 7/3. 3 goes into 7 2 times and 1 is left over. Here 2 is called the [color=#e49f44]quotient[/color] and 1 is called the [color=#e49f44]remainder[/color].
In this exercise, you are first given the numerator (7 in the example) and then the denominator (3) and you are then expected to output the quotient (2) and then the remainder (1).

=== levels/dance ===

$14975070588197
We all like the way Robot moves on the dance floor. That's why we want him to lead our dance team. 
	
The only problem is to make him come up with original dance sequences. How do you make creativity out of deterministic logic you ask?

The answer pseudo random number generators.
$15955150920362
In this level you only get one input, we call this the initial seed. The seed is put through the following steps to produce a pseudo random number.

In the algorithm below, "shl 1" means shift left once, "shl 2" means shift left twice and "shr 1" means shift right once.

[b]8 bit xorshift RNG:[/b][code][color=#87a8c8]
temp1     = seed  xor (seed  shr 1)
temp2     = temp1 xor (temp1 shl 1)
next_seed = temp2 xor (temp2 shr 2)
[/color][/code]
Next output next_seed mod 4, to move the robot. Finally use next_seed (before mod 4) as the seed to get the next number in the dance sequence and repeat.

(Notice the initial seed will never be 0)

Welcome to the component factory, the circuits you create in here will be usable as components in architecture levels.
The circuitry you create defines the behavior of the component and the layout defines its shape.
$12516102012088 This component has no area and will not be usable in levels. Place components on the map to give it area.
$14712417427860 Since this level is a tool and not a challenge, you can go to the level map and continue on when you want.

Game rules: There are 12 cards on the table and each player takes turn and must pick up between 1 and 3 cards. You start and the player who picks up the last card (the joker) loses.

Reading input will give you the current number of cards. Sending 1, 2 or 3 to output will pick up that number of cards. NAK 02 reacts immediately, so you may read the input immediately after your output to get the result of his action.

=== levels/leg_3 ===

$14060810229477 Add 6 registers to the map
$14960344494328
Sometimes it is useful to load a value directly from the program instead of from registers. This is called loading an immediate value. In the [color=#e49f44]LEG[/color] architecture we signal when we want to do this directly in the opcode. We can do that in the following way:

When the 8th bit of the opcode is [ON], use argument 1 as an immediate value, instead of as a register address.
When the 7th bit of the opcode is [ON], use argument 2 as an immediate value, instead of as a register address.

=== levels/test_lab ===

$11038144815919
This level uses programs to test your circuits. When the programs are run, this level checks if the "watched state" behaves the way you expect.

The lab has 2 extra keywords.

The [color=#c54d5e]expect[/color] keyword is used to describe what a value a memory address should hold next tick.

The first number after [color=#c54d5e]expect[/color] is index in the watched state, the second number is the expected value. The watched state indexes are the order the components are connected up in to the program component.

[img]dialogue/watched_state.png[/img]

For example:
[code][color=#c54d5e]expect[/color] [color=#eb9433]2[/color] [color=#eb9433]4[/color]
[color=#4a9658]copy[/color] [color=#eb9433]4[/color] [color=#4a9658]_[/color] [color=#4a9658]r2[/color][/code]

Here, the first line says that we expect the 2nd watched state slot to hold a value of 4 after the next tick.

All watched state is checked against expectations at every tick. All watched state is expected to be 0 at the start of the program, and expectations for memory components only change as you specifically change the expectations. The one exception are counters, these are naturally expected to increment each tick.

The second special keyword for the lab is [color=#c54d5e]set_input[/color]. With this you can control the input of the computer:
[color=#c54d5e]set_input[/color] [color=#eb9433]123[/color]

You can at any time also (re)import example tests by clicking below:
[url=import_overture][color=#e49f44]OVERTURE[/color][/url]

$15446846177093 Welcome to the lab. Like the component factory, this is not a normal level but a tool.
$16072814175447 Programming on buggy hardware is very frustrating. It is painful to suddenly be forced to reason about circuits, when you are in the middle of solving a programming problem. It is tempting to apply a quick circuit fix, so you can get back to solving the original problem. But now this quick fix broke something else in a program that used to work and so on. Therefore, when developing hardware try to aim for 100% reliability before you start programming!


=== levels/demux ===

$16057674753878 Create a component that can switch a signal between 2 pins.


=== levels/full_adder ===

$17063157033479
In the previous level we added together 2 inputs, this time we add 3. Once again, add the inputs together in binary, such that the result is either [ZERO] or [ONE].

$17098439090371
We need a way to directly move numbers from our program into registers. For this we use the immediate mode (when the two highest bits are [OFF][OFF]).

When in immediate mode the whole byte is interpreted as a number that we [SAVE] into REG 0. This means we can 
[SAVE] any value between 0 and 63.

The first 4 inputs will give you the following in order:
disk_nr - The highest disk number in the pile (2 to 4)
source - Which location number to move from
destination - Where to move the pile to
spare - The 3rd spot that is neither the source nor the destination

Control the crane with the following outputs:
0 - Move the magnet to spot 0

$10515630949378 We have hooked your machine up to our advanced robot and we want you to program it to shoot the space rats with lasers.


=== levels/xor_gate ===

$14093358515620 This is also known as an XOR gate. This level is difficult, so don't be discouraged if you don't get the answer right away.
$19182751521677 Last level you built a circuit that was [ON] when we were at the second tick. This level build a circuit that is [ON] when we are at the second OR third tick.


=== levels/xor ===

$12758156517177 Using the instructions of your computer, read the input twice and XOR the two values together

The length of our week is 4 days. Our weekdays are named Zero's day, One's day, Two's day and Three's day. I hear some earthlings number their Two's day incorrectly? 
	
It doesn't really surprise me.

=== levels/bit_adder ===

$13109388951000 We measure the universe with numbers. So your machine must learn to count.
$16564356062672
Treat the inputs as [ZERO] or [ONE] depending if they are [OFF] or [ON]. Add them together in binary, such that the result is either [ZERO] or [ONE].

As with normal addition, if the result cannot be described with one digit, set the carry to [ONE].


=== levels/byte_shift ===

$16023356915123
The task in this level is to shift the first input to the left by the value given in the second input. The second input will never exceed 7.

$10598344098990 [center]Shift the first input left by the number of places given by the second[/center]
$16216408139965
To [color=#e49f44]shift[/color] a value 1 left just means moving all the bits in a byte to the left by 1 position.
For example: [color=#e49f44]90 shl 1[/color]

[OFF] [ON] [OFF] [ON] [ON] [OFF] [ON] [OFF] would become:
[ON] [OFF] [ON] [ON] [OFF] [ON] [OFF] [OFF]

Shifting by 3: [color=#e49f44]90 shl 3[/color]
[OFF] [ON] [OFF] [ON] [ON] [OFF] [ON] [OFF] would become:
[ON] [ON] [OFF] [ON] [OFF] [OFF] [OFF] [OFF]


$18137790657923 In addition to giving you a shift left component, we also had the intern create a shift right component. All he had to do was to create the mirror version of this schematic.
$18518173140953 I recommend that you add [color=#e49f44]shift left[/color] and [color=#e49f44]shift right[/color] to your hardware for future levels.


=== levels/registers ===

$10661964231175 I have locked the red components of this level in place, since you always make a mess and don't leave enough space. The mess you make from now on is saved between levels, you no longer get to start fresh each level.
$10211777161405
These are the bit patterns for each [color=#c54d5e]source[/color] and [color=#e49f44]destination[/color].

[color=#c54d5e]Source[/color]:
[OFF] [OFF] [OFF]  REG 0 
[OFF] [OFF] [ON]  REG 1 
[OFF] [ON] [OFF]  REG 2 
[OFF] [ON] [ON]  REG 3 
[ON] [OFF] [OFF]  REG 4 
[ON] [OFF] [ON]  REG 5 
[ON] [ON] [OFF]  INPUT 
[ON] [ON] [ON]  UNUSED

[color=#e49f44]Destination[/color]:
[OFF] [OFF] [OFF]  REG 0 
[OFF] [OFF] [ON]  REG 1 
[OFF] [ON] [OFF]  REG 2 
[OFF] [ON] [ON]  REG 3 
[ON] [OFF] [OFF]  REG 4 
[ON] [OFF] [ON]  REG 5

$15888345020710
In this level you need to create a circuit which can copy from a [color=#c54d5e]source[/color] to a [color=#e49f44]destination[/color]. 

The instruction byte in this level determines the [color=#c54d5e]source[/color] and the [color=#e49f44]destination[/color]. 

Bits 1, 2 and 3 give the [color=#e49f44]destination[/color]. Bits 4, 5 and 6 give the [color=#c54d5e]source[/color].

$14108238519744 Time to create your master project, implementing the [color=#e49f44]OVERTURE[/color] computer architecture. This will be an actual Turing complete machine, a true computer in every way!
$14411286553593 Finally, the input and output components now have an additional pin. Set that pin [ON] when you want to read from input, or copy to output.
$14041158687959
[color=#c54d5e]Source[/color] and [color=#e49f44]destination[/color] can be 1 of 6 registers, we will name them REG 0 to REG 5 respectively. 
	
Additionally, this map has a dedicated input component, which can be the [color=#c54d5e]source[/color] and an output component, which can be the [color=#e49f44]destination[/color].


=== levels/double_number ===

$19766257822639
The input and output of this level are using bytes instead of bits. One of the two new components you are given takes a byte and splits it into bits and the other does the opposite.

Using those components, figure out how to double the input number (up to 127).


=== levels/counting_signals ===

$10724914203078
The output component of this level is a binary counter where the first 3 pins correspond to 1, 2 and 4.
Use the binary counter to count the number of signals.

Check [color=#e63e5b][url=counting_signals]this hint[/url][/color] if you get stuck

[i][tip]The solution for this level is not very neat and requires more components.[/tip][/i]
